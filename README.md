# Dr Trade - AI Trading Assistant (Frontend Demo)

This is a **Frontend-Only** version of the Dr Trade application. It demonstrates the UI/UX, Navigation, and Interaction flows without a real AI backend.

## Features
- **Frontend Only**: No server connection required. All responses are simulated locally.
- **Interactive UI**: Fully functional chat interface, mode toggles, and navigation.
- **APK Build**: Automated build via GitHub Actions.

## How to Download APK
1. Go to the **Actions** tab in this repository.
2. Click on the latest workflow run (e.g., "Documentation: Add README...").
3. Scroll down to the **Artifacts** section.
4. Download **app-release** (or `app-debug`).
5. Extract the zip file and install the APK on your Android device.

## Troubleshooting
If the app crashes on launch, ensure you are using the **app-release** version, as it bundles the necessary JavaScript code.
